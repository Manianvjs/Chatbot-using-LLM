Objective
The goal of this project is to create a robust chatbot that leverages both a pre-defined dataset and a large language model (GPT-4) to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses. The chatbot can answer queries based on a dataset of question-answer pairs and, when necessary, generate responses using the GPT-4 model. This hybrid approach allows for fast responses to known questions and sophisticated handling of more complex or novel queries.

Features
Dataset Integration:

Loading: The chatbot loads a dataset from a CSV file. The dataset contains pairs of questions and answers that the chatbot uses to respond to user queries.
Keyword Matching: The chatbot performs keyword matching to find the best answer from the dataset based on user input.
GPT-4 Integration:

Fallback Mechanism: If the dataset does not contain an appropriate answer for a given query, the chatbot uses the GPT-4 model to generate a response.
Context Management: Maintains conversation history to provide contextually relevant responses when using GPT-4.
Conversation History:

Logging: Keeps track of all interactions with the user, including both questions and answers, to maintain the flow of the conversation.
Enhanced Context: Uses conversation history to provide more accurate and contextually aware responses when generating replies with GPT-4.
Error Handling:

API Errors: Handles errors gracefully during API calls to the GPT-4 model, ensuring that the chatbot remains functional even if issues occur.
Fallback Responses: Provides default fallback responses in case of errors or missing dataset entries.
Logging and Debugging:

Detailed Logs: Logs various operations including user inputs, responses, and errors to help with debugging and understanding chatbot behavior.
Implementation
Dependencies:

pandas: For loading and processing the dataset.
openai: For interacting with the GPT-4 API.
logging: For detailed logging of chatbot activities.
Components:

DatasetChatbot Class: Main class that handles loading the dataset, processing user input, searching for answers, and interacting with the GPT-4 model.
Conversation Management: Methods to add to and manage conversation history.
Fallback Mechanism: Logic to switch between dataset-based answers and GPT-4 responses.
Execution:

Interactive Console: The chatbot runs in an interactive console where users can input queries, and the chatbot responds based on the dataset or GPT-4.
How It Works
Initialization:

Load the dataset containing question-answer pairs.
Set up logging for monitoring chatbot activities.
User Interaction:

Accept user input and check if it matches any question in the dataset.
If a match is found, respond with the dataset answer.
If no match is found, send the input to GPT-4 and respond with the generated answer.
Maintain conversation history for context.
Error Handling:

Log errors and provide a default fallback response if the GPT-4 API call fails.
Example Workflow
User Input: "What's the capital of France?"
Dataset Check: The chatbot finds a matching question in the dataset and responds: "The capital of France is Paris."
Fallback (if no match): For an unrecognized query, the chatbot queries GPT-4 for a response and provides it to the user.
Potential Extensions
Interactive Learning: Allow the chatbot to update its dataset with new Q&A pairs based on user interactions.
Advanced Search: Use semantic search or embeddings to improve question matching.
Web Interface: Develop a web-based interface for easier interaction with the chatbot.
This description provides an overview of the chatbot project, including its objectives, features, implementation details, and potential extensions. It highlights how the chatbot integrates both dataset-based responses and advanced language model capabilities to deliver a robust conversational experience.
